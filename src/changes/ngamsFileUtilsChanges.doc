Changes to ngamsFileUtils.py:

Modifications to _locateArchiveFile:
Returns a warning rather than raising an error if file is not found. This allows the given fileId to be potentially used as a containerId rather than just exiting the command.

Modifications to locateArchiveFile:
If _locateArchiveFile has returned a warning then function returns an overwritten list/array specifying this as well as the provided fileId.
