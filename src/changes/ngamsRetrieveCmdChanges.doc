Changes to ngamsRetrieveCmd.py:

Added import: ngamsDbCore

Modifications to genReplyRetrieve function:
It is now possible for this function to send back several results by the use of containers. If a container_name has been specified then the mime message generated will be of type multipart/mixed and will send all of the contents of a stored container seperated by a randomly generated deliminater. The new function also passes a unique header to ngamsServer.httpReplyGen to specify that the item being retrieved is, in fact, a container.
If a container_name is not specified then the command will function completely as normal.

Modifications to _handleCmdRetrieve function:
Instead of issuing an error if the given fileId is not found it will now check if the fileId can be used as a containerId. If not then an error is raised but if so then it is treated as the containerId.
All files with the given fileId are retrieved and individually located before being made ready for sending.
If only the containerId or the containerName is specified then the other will be obtained by querying the ngas_containers table.
If a fileId was provided and is valid as a fileId then the function will act as it normally would completely ignoring the new functionality.
