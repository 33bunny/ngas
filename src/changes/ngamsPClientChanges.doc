Recent changes that have been made to ngamsPClient.py:

Addition of the CRETRIEVE command:
This command is used to retrieve an archived container to the current directory. When called either a containerId or a containerName must be specified using the respective tags: -containerId and -containerName.
This command has already been deprecated as all CRETRIEVE functionality has been merged into the standard RETRIEVE command.

Modification of the RETRIEVE command:
This command was used to retrieve a single archived file by specifying at least a fileId and other parameters (see existing documentation for full usage). Additions to the system now allow it to retrieve an archived container by specifying either a -containerId or a -containerName. It is also possible (but not recommended) to specify a containerId by using the -fileId tag although this will take marginally longer than specifying it as a -containerId. The container will always be retrieved to the directory in which the command was called from and will be stored in a directory named after the retrieved containerName.

Addition in the CARCHIVE command:
This command is used to archive an entire directory as a container.
At the current level it will not progress down the directory tree and will archive documents in the specified directory only.
It is called by specifying CARCHIVE as the -cmd and the directory path as -fileUri. Each file will be stored in the system with the same randomly generated UUID. A new entry will also be saved into the ngas_containers table which, at the current implementation level, will store the UUID as primary key as well as container_name as the directory name, the total size of all the archived files and as well as the date of ingestion.

Work to be done:
Modify the ARCHIVE and possible CARCHIVE command to include a ingestion_rate parameter which is stored in the database.
Allow a directory to be specified when retrieving a container to allow it to be stored somewhere other than the current working directory.
Possibly merging of the CARCHIVE and ARCHIVE command to allow containers to be archived using only the ARCHIVE command such that the CARCHIVE plug-in could be removed.
