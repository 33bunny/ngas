NGAS Quick-Installation Guide
=============================

Installing NGAS is very simple and yet flexible. This quick-guide just covers
the most standard installation on a stand-alone server. The installation routine
covers a number of different scenarios, including test installations on the
Amazon EC2 cloud and also the installation of several servers in parallel.
It is also possible to install all the OS packages required for NGAS, but this
is currently limited to RedHat and CentOS based installations and obviously
requires root access to the server.

Pre-requisites:
---------------
In order to use the installation procedure you will need some version of python
running on your machine. Recommended versions include the 2.6 and 2.7 series.
If you are an advanced python user, you may already have a virtual environment
setup. If this is the case you can either just enable your default virtualenv, or
create a new one for this installation. If you are even more advanced and have
the fabric and boto modules installed already, you have all that's required and
can skip the rest of this section.

0) look at the output of python -V:

> python -V
Python 2.7

if it returns Python 2.6 or Python 2.7 or any version >= 2.6 <= 3.0 you are fine.

1) check whether you've got virtualenv installed already:

> which virtualenv
/usr/bin/virtualenv

If it is not installed you can execute the following:

> wget --no-check-certificate -q https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.10.tar.gz
> tar -xvzf virtualenv-1.10.tar.gz
> cd virtualenv-1.10
> python virtualenv.py .v_ngasdeploy

If virtualenv is installed already create a virtual environment in a directory
of your choice, e.g.:

> virtualenv -p python .v_ngasdeploy

3) activate the virtual environment:

> source .v_ngasdeploy/bin/activate

4) install fabric and boto:

> pip install fabric
> pip install boto

NOTE: This will install pip and boto into the virtualenv activated before and not
clutter up anything else.

5) In order to be able to execute the installation on a remote host you will need
to be able to connect to the target host without a password.
That means that you have to register your ssh public-key on that host (copy into
~/.ssh/authorized-keys of the user on the target host.


Installation of NGAS:
---------------------
The installation of the NGAS software is using the fabric framework, allowing the
whole provisioning of the server and the required setup steps locally or on
remote hosts. The deployment tasks and functions are all written in Python as well.
All that's required at this point is to run the fab command:

> fab --hosts=whatever.host --user=billythekid -f machine-setup/deploy.py user_deploy

where you have to replace whatever.host and billythekid with the hostname and user
name on that host where you want to install the software.

MAC specific installation notes:
--------------------------------
Please look up the special document in the doc folder.
