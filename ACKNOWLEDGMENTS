NGAS was originally developed and used extensively at the European Southern
Observatory (ESO) to archive the data at the observatories in Chile and mirror
the data to the headquarters in Germany. It has also been adopted by the
National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Socorro and Charlottesville, and
by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope. Both
organizations have contributed to its development as well.
