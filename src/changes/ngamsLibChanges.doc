Changes to ngamsLib.py:

Modifications to httpPost function:
If the passed dataRef is for a directory instead of a file then it will construct the header of a multi-part mime message which is then passed on the httpPostUrl along with an array of file paths representing each of the individual files contained in the directory.

Modifications to httpPostUrl function:
Added a new dataSouce type, that being FILESLIST.
If accepted as a files list then the remainder of the multi-part mime message is constructed using a randomly generated deliminator and each file is read and sent block-wise just like a standard file would be sent. An end of container deliminator is sent to signify the end of the mime message.

Modifications to _httpHandleResp function:
Added a check for a new header dictionary key: content-rtype.
If this exists then the data being received from the RETRIEVE command is in-fact for a container and a multi-part mime message is expected. Upon reception of the message it creates the directory specified by the container_name and stores each of the restored files from the mime message as individual files named by their respective filenames.
It returns the directory the files were stored in rather than an individual file name.
