This version of the ngamsPClient allows stand-alone installation. This means 
that this part of the source tree is independent from the rest.
Installation can be performed with a standard

$ python setup.py install

If executed inside a virtualenv the ngamsPClient command will be available
and can be called with -h to obtain the help page:

$ ngamsPClient -h
