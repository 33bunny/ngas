pCFITSIO README 

This package consists of a subset of functions from CFITSIO 2.0 which
has been wrapped into a Python module. While not all of CFITSIO's
functions were wrapped, this module has proven useful in order to
quickly read and write multiple extension FITS files and ASCII/Binary
FITS tables.
[pCFITSIO version prior to 0.99.0 used the Python Numeric package. It now used numarray]

Installation Instructions:
	
	You must have the full Python source code tree installed somewhere ($PYTHONROOT)

	You must obtain and compile CFITSIO 2.0 from
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html

	The Python Numerical package
(ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/python/) is also required in order to use
these routines.

Method 1:
	Edit Setup to point to the right locations of cfitsio 2.0 and the Numerical Python package.

	Type "python setup.py build" to build things and "python setup.py install" to install this module.
	This package requires access to the CFITSIO 2.0 header files which are assumed to be in the
	ST-ECF/ESO Scisoft direcotry structure. This can be changed by using "python setup.py build-ext --include_dirs=cfitsio_dir" manually.

Method 2:
	Edit Setup to point to the right locations of cfitsio 2.0 and
the Numerical Python package.

	Copy $PYTHONROOT/Misc/Makefile.pre.in in this directory

	Run "make -f Makefile.pre.in boot"

	Run "make"

	Copy pcfitsio.py and pcfitsio.so (and optionally fitsio.py)
somewhere pointed to by you PYTHONPATH, or in your current directory if you just want to test things.

Note:

	Not all of the cfitsio routines were wrapped. The cfitsio
routine names were preserved and their functionality is almost
unchanged. The wrapped functions uses Numeric arrays to deal with
passing data to and from Python and they all return Python lists when
the original CFITSIO function was meant to return/update more than one
argument.
	See the pcfitsio.html and the CFITSIO 2.0 manual for more
information.


	The module fitsio.py contains a few basic functions to read
and write images and read/update lists of keywords. Some documentation
is available inside the file itself.
