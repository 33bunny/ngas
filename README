The Next Generation Archive System
==================================

NOTE: This README file is not meant to describe the system in any detail. 
Please refer to the Installation Guide (./INSTALL) and the User Manual 
(./doc/VLT-MAN-19400-2739.pdf) for more details.

NGAS is a very feature rich, archive handling and management system. 
In its core it is a HTTP based object storage system. It can be deployed
on single small servers, or in globally distributed clusters. It supports
installation on many *IX flavors supporting Python. The implementation 
is pure Python, but there are a few dependencies on C libraries as well
and that may restrict the ability to install it on some of the more exotic
platforms. Once installed, the NGAS server is intended to run as a daemon.
It is possible to run more than one server on a single host and it is 
possible to run many servers across hundreds of nodes as well as across
various sites. The more advanced features allow mirroring of sites running
independent NGAS clusters, but it is also possible to run multiple clusters
against a central database. 

The system has been originally developed and used extensively at the 
European Southern Observatory to archive the data at the observatories in
Chile and mirror the data to the headquarters in Germany. It has also been
deployed at the NRAO in Socorro and Charlottesville and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is using the system to collect the data
directly at the control site in the Chilean Andes and then distribute the data 
to Santiago and further on to the ALMA regional centers in the US, Japan and
Germany. NGAS is controlling millions of files all around the world and it
is scaling very well. The version of NGAS delivered in this distribution is
a branch of the original ALMA version. It had been further developed and 
adopted to deal with the much higher data rate of the Murchison Widefield 
Array (MWA) and quite some work went into the installation and automatic test
features. 

1. Installation
Please refer to the INSTALL document in the same folder as this README file.

3. How to run the programs
The NGAS installation comes with a default minimal DB based on SQLite. This
DB is installed by default and is also used for software testing. While 
SQLite is perfectly fine for single host, single server installations, it
is not possible to use it for situations where a whole cluster of servers
need to connect to a central DB. This README just covers the minimal 
configuration using SQLite.


4. Post-Installation
The following two commands can be used to just make sure that the whole
installation is working fine.

* to start NGAS Server (e.g. using Sqlite, verbose mode 4)
	$NGAS_Server -cfg cfg/NgamsCfg.SQLite.mini.xml -autoOnline -v 4
* to start NGAS C Client (e.g. Archive command)
	$ngamsCClient -host localhost -port 7777 -cmd ARCHIVE -fileUri ~/NGAS/log/LogFile.nglog -mimeType application/octet-stream
	
	
if localhost doesn't work, try the name you gave to your computer, or try 127.0.1.1
It should report as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Host:           icrar-dirp01
Port:           7777
Command:        ARCHIVE

Error Code:     0

Message:        Successfully handled Archive Push Request for data file with URI: LogFile.nglog
Status:         SUCCESS

Sub-State:      IDLE
NG/AMS Version: v4.1-ALMA/2010-04-14T08:00:00
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* to run system test
	$cd /.../installation/directory/src/ngamsTest/
	$NGASTests -cfg ../../cfg/NgamsCfg.SQLite.mini.xml -NotifEmail <your.preferred@email.here>

5. Known Issues
* location of reference files are defined pointing to the previous build location. 
This may affect the some of the system tests including ngamsArchiveCmdTest, ngamsCClientTest, 
ngamsCloneCmdTest, ngamsDbSnapShotTest, ngamsIdleSuspensionTest, ngamsPClientTest etc.
* pcfitsio is imported in /.../src/ngamsTest/ngamsTestLib.py as a python module, yet the 
new system hasn't build pcfitsio as an egg that can be imported within the program. This 
may result errors in system tests.
