MAC OSX Installation notes:
===========================

Mac OSX installation has been completely overhauled. Now a local user installation can be performed with the command:

$ fab -u `whoami` -H localhost -f machine_setup/deploy.py user_deploy

This will perform the full installation under ~/ngas_rt with data files under ~/NGAS. It will use homebrew to install 
missing dependencies. If homebrew is not available it will be installed as well, but only if MacPorts is not installed,
in order to prevent nasty side-effects. At the end of the installation the .bash_profile file will be modified (a backup
of the original one is kept under ~/.bash_profile_orig).
