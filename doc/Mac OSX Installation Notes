MAC OSX Installation notes:

These notes reflect the installation I've performed on my Mac Book Pro Mid 2010 with Mountain Lion 10.8.2 installed.

The installation was performed on 2013-01-06.


1) NOTE: Run the fix below directly from the already installed ngas_rt directory rather than through
the fabric. This requires that the ngas_rt virtualenv is enabled by running:

source ~/ngas_rt/bin/activate

The buildout fails, because it can't find the BSD database include files and library. BSDDB is in additional_tars. Unpack to /tmp
and configure the installation to point to the ngas_rt root directory (--prefix=~/ngas_rt). 

cd /tmp
tar -xvzf /Users/awicenec/ngas_rt/additional_tars/db-6.0.20.tar.gz
cd db-6.0.20/build_unix
../dist/configure prefix=/Users/awicenec/ngas_rt


The compilation goes through without
problems. However the buildout still reports:
====
Can't find a local Berkeley DB installation.
(suggestion: try the --berkeley-db=/path/to/bsddb option)
====

This is due to the non-standard installation location of BSD DB. Thus run

$ pip install --no-clean bsddb3

in order to get a build directory of the module and then ran

$ export YES_I_HAVE_THE_RIGHT_TO_USE_THIS_BERKELEY_DB_VERSION=1

$ python2.7 setup.py --berkeley-db=~/ngas_rt build

and

$ python2.7 setup.py --berkeley-db=~/ngas_rt install

and then run buildout again:

fab -u awicenec -H localhost -f machine-setup/deploy.py ngas_buildout --set HOME=/Users/awicenec
