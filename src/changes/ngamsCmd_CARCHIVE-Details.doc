Details regarding the ngamsCmd_CARCHIVE.py:

The command was originally modeled using the code from ngamsCmd_QARCHIVE.py

Modifications to saveFromHttpToFile function:
Gets the intended save location of the received multipart mime message and uses that as the location for staging all the container files to be archived. Also acquires the final target location and stores the path for saving the archived files.
Receives the deliminater and container_name from the mime headers before reading in the data block wise and storing into the respective files based on the recovered filenames. Once a file has been stored into the staging are a list of the files is updated to include the file and the function returns.

Modifications to handleCMd function:
	imports: ngamsPlugInApi, ngamsGenDapi and uuid
Generated a new uuid to be used as the containerId and retrieves the stored containerName returned from saveFromHttpFile via saveInStagingFile.
For each file in the list of returned files a 'fake' resDapi record is created, the file is moved to its final destination and the database is updated to include the record. Once all files have been moved and the Db update a new record is created in the ngas_containers table to reference the new ingested container.
